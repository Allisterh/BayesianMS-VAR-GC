## Bayesian Estimation of Markov-Switching VARs for Granger Causal Inference in R

by Matthieu Droumaguet, Anders Warne, \& Tomasz Woźniak

> A block Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the Bayesian estimation of the Markov-switching Vector Autoregressive models with restrictions for Granger noncausality is provided, as well as an appropriate estimator for the marginal data density.
